sometimes microdot is too big to sit in ram as a py file.
the solution is to complie it to an mpy file.
this is done with pip install mpy-cross, ensuring that the mpy-cross and micropython versions match.

make sure you get micropython for pi pico w. if you get the pi pico version it will immediately complain about mip not being found.
this might not matter since mip would not get the precompiled libs we need anyway so this thing cant bootstrap itself regardless.


the board as built has a bug. all the resistors are 220 but with the cheapo rgb leds the red channels should have a smaller resistor. 100 looks good. TODO: solder this up
